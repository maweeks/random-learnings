# Markdown

Add a comment to the markdown file (won't be included in conversion of the file):

```markdown
[empty line]

[//]: # 'Your comment here!'
```

[//]: # 'Your comment here!'

Add a table (: for alignment):

```markdown
| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |
```
